# Socket-io-chat-server

Not really a chat server, this is a small [socket.io](https://socket.io/) server that acts as if it was a chat server, ment to be used by(socket-io-chat-client)[https://github.com/Pixxle/socket-io-chat-client]. This is the backend for a small hiring excerise for frontend engineers.
